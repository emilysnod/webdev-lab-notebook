### HTML

Definitey digging up the little knowledge about HTML I have! My strategy was to try things first even if I don't
quite remember, and see if I could just logic some of it out. I did end up watching the videos
for the form section, they answered all the questions I had. No other questions came to mind for this section,
though I do expect that to change in the future.

### Accessibility

For this exercise I did reference the video. I wasn't sure where to make the necissary changes to
address the specific accessability issues brought to light by Wave. I still have not figured out exactly
what all needs to be included when it comes to accessability, but I think Wave will definitely help.

### CSS
