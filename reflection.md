## Reflection Document

### HTML

Definitey digging up the little knowledge about HTML I have! My strategy was to try things first even if I don't
quite remember, and see if I could just logic some of it out. I did end up watching the videos
for the form section, they answered all the questions I had. No other questions came to mind for this section,
though I do expect that to change in the future.

### Accessibility

For this exercise I did reference the video. I wasn't sure where to make the necissary changes to
address the specific accessability issues brought to light by Wave. I still have not figured out exactly
what all needs to be included when it comes to accessability, but I think Wave will definitely help.

### CSS

I used the reference videos to check my work, and pretty much entirely for the last exercise. It is unclear
to me weather the exercises are meant to be able to be competed without the video. While I can usually get the visuals
just about right, the instructions don't have any explanation of the expected functionality. So if that is
is intentional, then no problem, but if not, a short blurb about how the page is supposed to function would be very helpful.

### Flexbox

I followed the video with this exercise, generally had a hard time with the concepts, but by the end they were making sense.
I did notice that the path to the style sheet was incorrect and that was messing me up for a while but I figured it out.
Lastly, it seems as if the video is a little out dated - I found that flex-flow: column wrap; did not work, so I had to
split them up into flex-flow: column; and flex-wrap: wrap;

### Grid

Felt like i really get into a groove with this one, being similar to flexbox, I watched the first 2 exercises and then
tried my had at the rest befor checking my work. Not much else.

### Bootstrap

I liked this exercise - it was puzzly! Got this one done by myself and checked the answers. Pretty straight forward.

### Javascript

definitely feeling the burn, I mostly followed the videos, I wasn't sure what to expect with javascript. Definitely
needed the 2 weeks for this session, followed the videos for some exercises, checked my work after for others. Definitely
a change after mostly doing HTML up until now.

### jQuery

Felt like this was a good balance of challange with it being a little similar to javascript and having different notation.
I did the first assignment myself (01-dom), the second was a little scary and I ended up coding along with the video, trying to
guess what comes next and usually being completely wrong >.<
