## Reflection Document

### HTML

Definitey digging up the little knowledge about HTML I have! My strategy was to try things first even if I don't
quite remember, and see if I could just logic some of it out. I did end up watching the videos
for the form section, they answered all the questions I had. No other questions came to mind for this section,
though I do expect that to change in the future.

### Accessibility

For this exercise I did reference the video. I wasn't sure where to make the necissary changes to
address the specific accessability issues brought to light by Wave. I still have not figured out exactly
what all needs to be included when it comes to accessability, but I think Wave will definitely help.

### CSS
I used the reference videos to check my work, and pretty much entirely for the last exercise. It is unclear
to me weather the exercises are meant to be able to be competed without the video. While I can usually get the visuals
just about right, the instructions don't have any explanation of the expected functionality. So if that is
is intentional, then no problem, but if not, a short blurb about how the page is supposed to function would be very helpful.
